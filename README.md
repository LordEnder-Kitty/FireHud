# FireHud

This is a client only mod which provides more settings than you'll ever need to customize the onscreen effect when on fire.

**Everything is on vanilla settings by default**

The config, made using [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config), is accessable through either [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) or, I have added a button in the game options beside the videos settings button. This button is toggleable and you may move it around as well.

This mod was made as a passion project after I went netherite mining and remembered how annoying fire was.

You may also adjust the volume and pitch of fire blocks in the config.

Believe me when I say I have really gone overkill on customization. Chances are that I'll also add more features in the future. If you have any good ideas for additions to this mod, don't hesitate to go to the issues page on the github and make a suggestion. I will most likely read it and consider it.

Some features of note:
- Adjusting the position of vanilla fire.
- Adjusting the opactity of vanilla fire.
- Disabling vanilla fire entirely.
- Enabling other customizable redesigns of the hud.
- Adjusting the in-lava fog. Making it easier to see under lava.
- Player ignites on soul fire rather than normal, orange fire when in soul fire.
- And many other useful, but completely optional features.
